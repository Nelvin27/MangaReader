# MangaReader

The manga directory should be in Downloads Folder.

It should looks like this: C:\Users*user*\Downloads\Manga

The cover art for the manga should be in the respective folder.

The cover art directory should look like this: "C:\Users*user*\Downloads\Manga*manga title*\cover.jpg"

The app only accepts cover.jpg at the moment, so cover.png or etc. will not work.
